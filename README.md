# Analyiss of Airbnb Listings

## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb detailed listings data from NYC to better understand to help new and existing hosts on Airbnb improve their listings and ensure their accounts and listing are more appealing to guests, and consequently, are more competitive. 

### Questions I was trying to answer:
1. What is word difference between listing titles in the two groups? Should you use all capitals in your title?
2. What is word difference between listing descriptions in the two groups? Neighborhood overviews?
3. How do Amenities differ in the two groups?
4. What is word difference between host sections in the two groups?
5. What can we learn from guest reviews?


The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here. However, you can see pieces of the analysis here. This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.

## File Descriptions
There is a jupyter notebook in the doc folder that showcases the work performed related to the analysis. Please note, not all exploratory steps are included in this notebook to improve notebook readability. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional lib.py file that contains some helper functions to perform the analysis.

## Results
The main findings of the analysis can be found at the post available [here](https://olha-maslova.medium.com/5-things-that-distinguish-highly-rated-airbnb-listings-40ecf1bbfdfb).
